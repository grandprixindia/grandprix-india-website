# Creating a Square Logo for Google Knowledge Graph

## Quick Solution

Google Knowledge Graph requires your logo to be **square** (1:1 aspect ratio).

Your current logo: `1710×578` (wide rectangle)
Required: Square, ideally `112×112` to `336×336` pixels

## Option 1: Use Your Logo Designer (RECOMMENDED)

Ask your logo designer to create a **square version**:

**Requirements:**
- Square aspect ratio (1:1)
- Minimum: 112×112 pixels
- Recommended: 200×200 to 336×336 pixels
- SVG format preferred (or PNG with transparent background)
- Keep the logo centered with padding around it

## Option 2: Create Square Version Yourself

### Using Online Tools:

1. **Canva** (free):
   - Create new design: 512×512 pixels
   - Upload your logo
   - Center it, add padding
   - Export as PNG (transparent) or SVG

2. **Photopea** (free online Photoshop):
   - Open your logo
   - Create new canvas: 512×512 pixels
   - Paste and center your logo
   - Export as PNG/SVG

3. **GIMP** (free desktop):
   - Open logo
   - Canvas → Resize canvas to square
   - Center logo
   - Export

### Using Design Software:

**Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop:**
```
1. Create artboard: 512×512px
2. Place your logo centered
3. Add equal padding on all sides
4. Export as SVG (preferred) or PNG
```

## Option 3: I Can Create a Square Placeholder

I can create a simple square version by:
1. Extracting your logo's key elements
2. Adding square padding
3. Creating a square SVG file

## File Naming

Once you have the square version:
- Name it: `logo-square.svg` (or `logo-square.png`)
- Place it in: `/public/` folder
- We'll update the code to use it for Knowledge Graph

## Testing

After creating the square logo:
1. Verify dimensions are square (e.g., 512×512)
2. Check it looks good when displayed square
3. Test at: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results

## Important Notes

- **Don't stretch your logo** to fit square - that looks bad
- **Add padding** around the logo to make it square
- **Keep it centered** in the square
- The square version is ONLY for Google Knowledge Graph
- Your website can still use the original wide logo
